## Installation

```
(Optional) It's recommended to use the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for the better environment of the development.
Luckily, this project's package.json file is inscribed with this dependency, so using the previous command, nodemon is installed to your project automatically.

After successfully installing all modules and dependecies run the following command in your current folder
```sh
npm start
```
Or, using nodemon you can run like this,
```sh
npm devStart
```
